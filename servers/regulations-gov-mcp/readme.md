# regulationsgov-mcp

<!-- mcp-name: com.1102tools/regulations-gov-mcp -->

MCP server for the Regulations.gov API. Federal rulemaking dockets, proposed rules, final rules, public comments, and comment period tracking.

Optional free API key for higher rate limits. Standalone MCP use is an advanced, self-supported path; packaged agents are the maintained beginner path.

*Tested and hardened through five rounds of integration testing against the live Regulations.gov API, including a round-7 independent re-audit with live verification. 197 regression tests covering 1 P0 catastrophic bug, 10 P1 silent-wrong-data bugs (including `agency_id=""` returning all 1,951,938 records), 7 P2 validation gaps, and 12 round-7 findings fixed. See [testing.md](testing.md) for the full testing record.*

## What it does

Exposes the Regulations.gov API plus a credential-readiness check as 9 MCP tools:

**Core**
- `search_documents` - Search proposed rules, final rules, notices with flexible filters
- `get_document_detail` - Full document details with optional attachments
- `search_comments` - Search public comments (by docket, document, or keyword)
- `get_comment_detail` - Full comment text and submitter info
- `search_dockets` - Search rulemaking and nonrulemaking dockets
- `get_docket_detail` - Docket metadata, abstract, and RIN

**Workflow**
- `open_comment_periods` - Currently open comment periods across procurement agencies
- `far_case_history` - Full lifecycle of a FAR/DFARS rulemaking case

## Get your own API key (strongly recommended)

This server hits `api.regulations.gov`, which uses api.data.gov for rate
limiting.

- **Without a key**: falls back to the shared `DEMO_KEY` which is capped at
  **~10 requests per hour (live-measured) across everyone using it**, so
  you'll hit 429 errors within a couple of prompts.
- **With a personal key**: 1,000 requests per hour, yours alone.

**Get a free key (takes 30 seconds):**

1. Go to [open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/#getting-started](https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/#getting-started) (or directly at [api.data.gov/signup](https://api.data.gov/signup/))
2. Enter your name and email: no approval, no wait
3. Copy the key from the confirmation page
4. Paste it into your client config as `REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY` (see below)

The same api.data.gov key works for every api.data.gov-backed API
(Regulations.gov, GSA Per Diem, NASA, FEC, FCC, etc.), so if you already
have one for another 1102tools MCP you can reuse it.

## Installation

```bash
uvx regulationsgov-mcp
```

## Configuration

MCP is an open standard, and compatible clients can run this server. Use the block below as the server definition and adapt its placement to your client.

**Recommended (with your own key):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "regulationsgov": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--refresh-package", "regulationsgov-mcp", "--from", "regulationsgov-mcp", "regulationsgov-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "REGULATIONS_GOV_API_KEY": "paste-your-api-data-gov-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Without a key** (works for a handful of calls per hour, then 429s until the hour rolls over):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "regulationsgov": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--refresh-package", "regulationsgov-mcp", "--from", "regulationsgov-mcp", "regulationsgov-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `--refresh-package` flag tells uv to check PyPI for a newer release each time your client launches the server, so fixes arrive automatically; without it, uv keeps serving whatever version it first cached. It adds a moment of network time at startup, so raise your platform's MCP startup timeout if it enforces a short one.

Restart the client and the tools appear.

## Example prompts

- "What FAR cases have open comment periods right now?"
- "Show me the full docket history for FAR-2023-0008."
- "Find all proposed rules from DARS posted in the last 6 months."
- "How many public comments were submitted on FAR Case 2023-008?"
- "Search for rulemaking dockets related to cybersecurity at DoD."
- "Find all SBA rules about size standards from the last year."

## Important: case-sensitive filter values

Regulations.gov filter values are CASE-SENSITIVE. Use exact casing:
- Document types: `Proposed Rule`, `Rule`, `Notice` (not lowercase)
- Docket types: `Rulemaking`, `Nonrulemaking`
- Lowercase values silently return 0 results with no error

## Companion tools

- `federal-register-mcp`: what was published in the Federal Register
- `regulationsgov-mcp`: the docket structure, public comments, and comment period status
- `ecfr-mcp`: what the regulation currently says after amendments

Together these three cover the full regulatory pipeline from proposal through public comment to codified rule.

## Request pacing

Every request and pagination subrequest uses a provisional 4-second
cross-process anti-burst interval by default. Regulations.gov and Per Diem
share a local `api.data.gov` bucket when they use the same key. This does not
increase provider quota or coordinate the key on another computer. Override
with `FEDERAL_API_MIN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, use `0` to deliberately disable it,
and use `FEDERAL_API_PACING_DIR` to relocate local pacing state.
