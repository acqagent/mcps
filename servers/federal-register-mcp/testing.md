# Federal Register MCP: Testing Record

## Executive Summary

This Model Context Protocol server exposes the Federal Register API as 8 callable tools for rulemaking tracking, FAR case history, comment-period monitoring, and regulatory research since 1994. It was hardened across six audit rounds: an initial hardening pass that fixed 17 findings, a retroactive deep audit that surfaced 12 more hidden bugs, a Hypothesis property-testing round, and a round 6 correctness audit against the live archive and the API's own OpenAPI spec that surfaced 12 further verified findings. Two signature findings, one per methodology era: a pydantic validation crash on every `list_agencies` call that was invisible to unit tests awaiting raw coroutines instead of invoking through the FastMCP pipeline, and a document-number validator that rejected the entire pre-2011 archive because prior rounds only ever tested junk inputs, never legacy-real ones. The MCP ships with 232 regression tests (132 offline plus 100 live-gated).

## 1.0.3 Safety Release Verification

The complete offline suite passed 132 tests with 100 live tests gated. Shared
pacing tests additionally verified cross-process serialization, override
validation, keyless-service protection, and `Retry-After` handling. No federal
API was called.

## What Was Tested

The MCP exposes 8 tools covering the Federal Register API surface. Testing covered all of them end-to-end.

**Core:** `search_documents`, `get_document`, `get_documents_batch`, `get_facet_counts`

**Reference:** `list_agencies`, `get_public_inspection`, `open_comment_periods`

**Workflow:** `far_case_history`

Each tool was exercised for argument validation, input sanitization, date format checking, empty-input detection (empty strings, empty arrays, whitespace-only), payload size bounds, response-shape guarantees, error translation (including stripping HTML from 404 bodies), and real-world data handling against the live public Federal Register API.

## How It Was Tested

### Testing discipline

Prior unit tests in v0.1.x awaited raw coroutines directly, which bypassed the FastMCP tool pipeline and its pydantic return validation. This was the failure mode that hid the `list_agencies` crash: FastMCP validates every tool's return against its type annotation, but the 0.1.1 smoke test awaited the raw coroutine and never triggered the validation layer. The hardening program switched to invoking tools through `mcp.call_tool(name, kwargs)` the way a real MCP client does. That change surfaced the pydantic crash that had been present since v0.1.

### Audit rounds

| Release | Context | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1.1 | Initial release with unit tests | Smoke test said OK (wrong) |
| 0.2.0 | First real hardening pass through `mcp.call_tool` pipeline | 17 findings fixed (list_agencies crash, payload bombs, basic validation) |
| 0.2.1 | Cross-MCP `extra='forbid'` back-port from sam-gov-mcp 0.3.1 | 1 cross-fix applied |
| 0.2.2 | Retroactive deep audit with live-gated suite | 12 additional findings including `far_case_history` docket matching, `get_documents_batch` empty arrays, `get_facet_counts` validation gaps |
| 0.2.6 | Round 5: Hypothesis property punishment (500 examples per property) plus 100+ live calls | 2 P2 None-handling crashes fixed |
| 1.0.0 | MCP Python SDK v2 migration, no tool behavior change | Suite re-verified against SDK 2.0 |
| 1.0.1 | Round 6: correctness audit, contract diff against the API's own OpenAPI spec plus ~60 live probes through `mcp.call_tool` | 12 verified findings fixed (pre-2011 archive lockout, open_comment_periods missing the soonest deadlines, FAC partial history, CFR filters absent) |

### Live audit status

The repository includes 96 live-gated regression tests executable via `FR_LIVE_TESTS=1 pytest` covering real document search, single-document fetch (modern and legacy pre-2011 numbers), batch fetch, facet counts, agency listing, public inspection queue, open comment periods, FAR case history (including the FAC 2025-06 completeness check), and CFR title/part filtering. Federal Register is a free, public API with no authentication requirement.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Priority 1: Crashes and silent wrong data

Fourteen items in this class across initial hardening and deep audit.

**Crashes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| **`list_agencies` pydantic crash on every call.** The return type was declared `dict[str, Any]` but the API returns a bare list of 470 agencies. FastMCP validates returns against pydantic schemas and threw a `DictModel` validation error on every call. Prior unit tests missed this because they awaited the raw coroutine and bypassed the validation layer. | Return type changed to `list[dict[str, Any]]` with optional slim-mode field set. Regression test invokes via `mcp.call_tool` to exercise the full pipeline. |

**Payload bombs (known at shipping, fixed in 0.2.0):**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `get_public_inspection` returned a 170KB payload on unfiltered calls. | Slim-mode field set by default; `include_detail=True` opt-in for full payload. |
| `open_comment_periods` returned 188KB with a hardcoded `per_page=100`. | `per_page` bounded and slim-mode applied. |
| `list_agencies` returned a 700KB dump of all 470 agencies with full descriptions. | Slim fields by default plus optional `query` filter and `include_detail` flag. |
| `search_documents` allowed `per_page=1000`. A single response of roughly 2MB could blow the MCP token cap. | Lowered to `per_page <= 100` with documented guidance. |

**Silent wrong data from deep audit (0.2.2):**

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| **`far_case_history(docket_id="x")` returned 65 unrelated documents** via 1-character docket match across all dockets. | Minimum 3-character docket_id enforced. (Round 6 correction to this record: upstream docket matching is token-based, not substring, and no prefix-match logic was ever shipped; the earlier version of this row claimed one was.) |
| **`get_documents_batch` with empty entries `["", "", ""]` sent `,,` to the API** which returned all 10,000 documents. | Empty and whitespace-only entries rejected; at-least-one-non-empty enforced. |
| **`search_documents` with a 10,000-character term triggered an HTTP 414 URI Too Large** and the raw HTML response body leaked to the caller. | Term length capped at 500 characters; `_clean_error_body` helper strips HTML from error responses. |
| **`get_facet_counts` accepted any string as a date.** `"2026/01/01"` was silently ignored (filter dropped) and the tool returned unfiltered data. | Date format enforced as `YYYY-MM-DD` with actionable error. |
| **`get_facet_counts agencies=[]` silently ignored the filter** and returned the full agency aggregate. | Empty-list rejected; at-least-one-filter enforced. |
| **`get_facet_counts` reversed date range (`gte > lte`) silently returned `{}`** instead of an error. | Reversed ranges raise actionable error. |
| **`get_facet_counts` with no filters returned the entire all-time aggregate dataset.** | At-least-one-filter guard enforced. |
| **`search_documents docket_id=" "` (whitespace-only) was treated as the "All Documents" filter.** | Whitespace stripped and empty-after-strip rejected. |
| **`search_documents term=" "` had the same problem** and returned everything. | Same whitespace handling applied. |

### Priority 2: Validation gaps

Ten items in this class:

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `search_documents` reversed date ranges silently returned 0 documents. | Reversed ranges raise actionable error. |
| `search_documents` bad date formats silently passed through (YYYY-MM-DD validator missing). | Validator added. |
| `search_documents agencies=[]` and `doc_types=[]` silently ignored. | Empty-list rejected. |
| `search_documents per_page` and `page` were unbounded. | Clamped. |
| 404 responses leaked raw `<html xmlns...>` body to the caller. | `_clean_error_body` helper strips HTML. |
| `search_documents docket_id` and `regulation_id_number` accepted arbitrarily long strings (future 414 risk). | Length-clamped. |
| `get_facet_counts` had parallel validation gaps as `search_documents`. | Same validators applied. |
| `list_agencies query=""` returned all 470 agencies (fine), but `query=" "` returned 0 (inconsistent). | Whitespace stripped; empty-after-strip returns all. |
| `get_public_inspection keyword_filter=""` matched everything. | Empty-after-strip treated as "no filter" with clear output flag. |
| `get_document` accepted `#`, `?`, `&`, `%` in document numbers and produced confusing 404s. | `_validate_doc_number` helper enforces valid shape. |

### Priority 3: Cleanup items

Six items including a stale `USER_AGENT = "federal-register-mcp/0.1.1"`, misleading hardcoded "Verify the document_number" text in 404 messages for agency and facet endpoints, pre-1994 dates silently accepted (Federal Register did not exist before 1994), inconsistent `_strip_or_none` vs length-clamp vs WAF-style validation across tools, and the lack of a live-gated regression suite before 0.2.2. All resolved.

### Helpers added (0.2.2)

The 0.2.2 deep audit introduced a consistent set of input and response helpers reused across all 8 tools: `_strip_or_none`, `_require_min_length`, `_clamp_str_len`, `_validate_doc_number`, `_warn_pre_fr_date`, `_clean_error_body`. Extended date validation, empty-list rejection, and page/per_page clamps were propagated into `get_facet_counts`. The `per_page` cap was lowered from 1000 to 100.

### Round 5 (0.2.6): Hypothesis property punishment

500-example property tests over every validator plus 100+ live calls. Two P2 None-handling crashes fixed (`_validate_doc_number` on None input, `_clean_error_body` on non-string bodies).

### Round 6 (1.0.1): correctness audit against the live archive

A fresh audit with a different question: not "does the server reject bad input" but "does it return the right answers for real input". Method: diff the exposed parameter surface against the API's own OpenAPI spec (`/api/v1/documentation.json`), then verify tool output against direct API calls, all through `mcp.call_tool`. Twelve verified findings, every one carrying a live repro:

| Finding | Fix |
|---|---|
| **`get_document`/`get_documents_batch` rejected the entire pre-2011 archive.** The document-number pattern accepted only modern 'YYYY-NNNNN'; the live archive serves 'E9-12940', 'X94-70302', 'Z9-10645', and 2-digit-year forms back to 1994, all verified retrievable upstream while the tools refused them. | Loose URL-safe shape check covering every live-verified family; the API's 404 decides unknown numbers. |
| **`open_comment_periods` missed the soonest-closing deadlines entirely.** It fetched the `limit` most recently PUBLISHED documents; documents closing the same day (published months earlier) never appeared while the docstring promised soonest-first. | Scans up to 500 open documents oldest-published first, sorts by close date, returns the first `limit`. |
| **`open_comment_periods` reported the page size as `total_open`** (5 claimed, 985 real). | Reports the API's true count plus `scanned` and `returned`. |
| **`open_comment_periods` excluded RULE-type documents** (41 interim/direct final rules had open periods at audit time). | RULE added to the type filter. |
| **`far_case_history` returned a partial set on partial docket hits.** The term fallback fired only on zero: 'FAC 2025-06' returned 1 of 4 documents. | Always runs docket AND quoted-term searches, merges deduped by document number. |
| **`far_case_history` silently truncated at 100** ('FAR Case' matched 1625). | `truncated` flag plus `docket_matches`/`term_matches` counts. |
| **`get_documents_batch` N=1 collapsed to the bare document** (no count/results wrapper). | Wrapped client-side as `{"count": 1, "results": [doc]}`. |
| **`get_facet_counts` doc_types was an unvalidated string list**; `["rule"]` silently returned `{}` (reads as "zero documents") while `["RULE"]` showed 153. | Same PRORULE/RULE/NOTICE/PRESDOCU literal as `search_documents`. |
| **Pre-1994 guard was asymmetric**: lte dates slipped through silently. | Both sides raise in both tools. |
| **PI parent-agency filters matched nothing** (PI documents carry only the filing sub-agency; matching was slug-only). | Matches slug, name, and raw name with a hyphens-as-spaces fallback; docstring caveat. |
| **CFR location filters absent** despite being documented upstream (48 CFR part 52 alone covers 1086 documents). | `cfr_title`/`cfr_part` added to `search_documents` and `get_facet_counts`. |
| **Facet families daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly unavailable** though live-verified working. | Facet literal extended. |

**Methodology lesson.** Rounds 1 through 5 tested junk inputs exhaustively (control characters, empty strings, reversed ranges) but never legacy-real inputs: the document-number validator that round 4 shipped as a fix is what locked out 17 years of archive. And output risk was framed entirely as payload size (the slim-mode pattern) while result correctness went unchecked: `open_comment_periods` could pass every existing test and still miss every deadline closing this week. Round 6's rule: for each tool, verify at least one known-real answer end-to-end against the upstream API before hardening inputs.

## Test Coverage

The repo ships 228 regression tests (132 offline, 96 live-gated). All pass on every release cycle.

| File | Purpose | Test count |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/test_validation.py` | Main regression suite covering rounds 1 through 4 findings, plus live-gated integration tests | 77 |
| `tests/test_round_5.py` | Round 5 Hypothesis property punishment plus extensive live audit | 105 |
| `tests/test_round_6.py` | Round 6 correctness findings: legacy document numbers, batch shape, FAR/FAC dual query, open-comment scanning, CFR filters, PI agency matching, plus live confirmations | 46 |
| `tests/stress_test.py` | Round 1 scenarios (retained for reproducibility) | N/A (scenario script) |

Regression tests invoke tools through the FastMCP registry (`mcp.call_tool`). This is the discipline that surfaced the `list_agencies` pydantic crash. An autouse fixture resets the shared httpx client between tests.

## Cross-MCP Context

This MCP is one of eight servers in the 1102tools federal-contracting MCP suite (`bls-oews-mcp`, `ecfr-mcp`, `gsa-calc-mcp`, `gsa-perdiem-mcp`, `regulationsgov-mcp`, `sam-gov-mcp`, `usaspending-gov-mcp`, and this one). All eight were hardened under the same playbook. Patterns reused or confirmed here:

- **"Raw coroutine vs MCP pipeline" testing discipline** was most clearly demonstrated here. The `list_agencies` pydantic crash was present on every call since v0.1 but was invisible to tests that awaited the raw coroutine. Only invoking through `mcp.call_tool` triggered the FastMCP return validation.
- **Payload-bomb slim-mode pattern** (`include_detail=False` by default, opt-in for full payload) was applied here to `list_agencies`, `get_public_inspection`, and `open_comment_periods`, and reused across the suite.
- **`extra='forbid'` cross-fix** back-ported from sam-gov-mcp 0.3.1 in 0.2.1.
- **`_clean_error_body` helper** to strip HTML from 404 responses was codified here and reused in other MCPs that face similar raw-HTML leaks.

## What Was Not Tested

- **Rate-limit behavior.** Federal Register does not document numeric limits. The MCP now applies a provisional 3-second cross-process gate to every request and honors `Retry-After` without automatic retries.
- **Pre-1994 documents.** Federal Register did not exist before 1994. The MCP now warns on pre-1994 dates but does not predict which specific pre-1994 queries will return zero.
- **Historical agency reorganizations.** When an agency is merged or renamed, historical documents may appear under the old agency slug. The MCP passes through the Federal Register API's agency mapping but does not back-fill historical relationships.
- **Public inspection queue timing.** The public-inspection queue changes throughout the day. The MCP returns the queue as of the call; real-time updates are not pushed.

## Verification

All testing artifacts are in the repository. The methodology and fixes are reviewable commit-by-commit in git history. The regression test suite runs via `pytest` in the repo root and can be re-executed by anyone. The live suite runs with `FR_LIVE_TESTS=1 pytest` and requires no API key (Federal Register is a free, public API).

**Testing Methodology**

Evaluators: James Jenrette, 1102tools, with Claude Code Opus 4.7 (1M context, max effort, Claude Max 20x subscription) during the hardening playbook execution.

Testing spanned six rounds from initial hardening (17 findings including the pydantic crash and payload bombs) through cross-MCP `extra='forbid'` application, a retroactive deep audit (12 additional findings), Hypothesis property punishment (round 5), and a round 6 correctness audit against the live archive and the API's own OpenAPI spec (12 verified findings). The live regression suite runs against the production Federal Register API when enabled with `FR_LIVE_TESTS=1`.

Test count: 232 regression tests (132 offline, 100 live-gated). Total items addressed: 44. Current version: 1.0.4. PyPI: `federal-register-mcp`.

## Round 7 (2026-08-18): suite-wide live verification (super-cycle)

The full live-gated suite ran wholesale against production for the first time
(historically prevented by key quotas): 228 passed (full live pass, 1m22s). No new server
defects. Added `tests/test_audit_r7.py`: 4
one-call-per-test live contract anchors re-stamping this server's headline
fixes against production (all verified green on landing), a suite-wide pacing
conftest with a `live_smoke` marker, and a per-test client reset so batched
live runs cannot hit the cached-AsyncClient/closed-event-loop trap.

## RC5 pacing remediation (2026-08-22)

Version 1.0.4 carries the suite-wide asynchronous pacing-lock correction. The full offline lane passed (132 tests; 100 live-gated tests skipped), including deterministic same-process concurrency coverage. The published PyPI wheel was then installed in an isolated cache and completed MCP startup and `tools/list` with 8 tools.
